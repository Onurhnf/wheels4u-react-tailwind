# Wheels 4U Frontend(React - Vite) - Vehicle Rental Application Admin Panel

In this project, an admin panel for a vehicle rental application has been designed. It can be considered a fullstack project; however, the backend logic has not been fully implemented. For the backend service, I have used Supabase. Supabase is an open-source platform that provides various services for building and scaling applications with PostgreSQL database. These services include real-time database functionality, authentication, RESTful API and similar features.

## Features:

- Dashboard: View user performance and achievements within specific date ranges.
- Bookings: Create new bookings and list existing ones.
- Wheels: Add new vehicles, update existing ones, or delete them.
- CRM: List users only for now.

This project is a public demo, allowing anyone to view the information they have created. However, users cannot see others peronalized informations or manipulate the data created by other users. While, logically, the dashboard should be personalized, a general dataset is used here to ensure that the initial user doesn't encounter an empty screen. This approach was chosen intentionally to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used
